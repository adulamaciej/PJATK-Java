Create a Square class with fields int length, number and static int counter. Write a constructor
that receives int length as an argument and initializes the fields accordingly. Write a getArea method
and override the toString method to return number and area
In the Square class declaration, add the Comperable<Square> interface and thus implement
the compareTo method
In the main method, create 5 Square objects and add them to the list. Then print them to the
console, sort them using the sort method from the Collections class and print them to the console again.
