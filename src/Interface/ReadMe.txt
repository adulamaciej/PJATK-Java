Prepare the IAuto and IBoat interfaces. In these interfaces, create a
default void Move() method that will move these vehicles accordingly.
Then create 3 classes Auto, Boat and Amphibious. Remember to solve
the problem in the case of the Amphibious class that must implement
both interfaces and move depending on the surface.
